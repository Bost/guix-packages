# `babashka` and nonguix `binary-build-system`

[`babashka`](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) is distributed as an almost static binary. On my system only a couple libraries can't be found out of the box.

[`nonguix`](https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix/) is a Guix channel that provides packages that can't be included in the main repo for licensing reasons. Among the packages themselves, it comes with various extremely usefuls modules, like the `binary-build-system`.

This build system allows you to take something which is distributed as a binary, describe its inputs, namely the missing libraries from `ldd` and fix the [rpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) automatically.

I've used it for the first time to package `babashka` (.scm [here](../packages/babashka.scm)).

Because channels can specify their dependencies, I just had to edit [.guix-channel](../.guix-channel) for `binary-build-system` to be available in my packages. The [guix-gaming-channel](https://gitlab.com/guix-gaming-channels/games) also makes extensive use of nonguix's modules, those two channels are an excellent reference when it comes to figuring out how to package weird things.
