# `starship` and building rust in Guix

[starship](https://starship.rs) is a "cross-shell prompt". Compared to roll-your-own or things like [Oh My Bash](https://ohmybash.github.io/), it's a simpler/faster way to get a "smart" shell prompt that understands git, python virtualenv, etc.

Let's try to build it.

## First steps

Put `rust` and `cargo` into a throwaway profile:

```
$ guix install -p ~/temp/build-starship rust rust:cargo
The following packages will be installed:
   rust       1.39.0
   rust:cargo 1.39.0

The following derivation will be built:
   /gnu/store/pcgw7vmxazjh1xp9i5bpvs8x8jjl0y9d-profile.drv
The following profile hooks will be built:
   /gnu/store/1qilh56yp3v54hmzx51kacsq9sf213pa-fonts-dir.drv
   /gnu/store/b6f3zhwklnjgkxkw78m5lyb6l7f79ly2-ca-certificate-bundle.drv
   /gnu/store/v1ipyi07vl8km9y3qalvab9wc4x7sj5k-manual-database.drv
   /gnu/store/znqm6rzmkarvaxvn0a4yp13fw4393h3q-info-dir.drv
building CA certificate bundle...
building fonts directory...
building directory of Info manuals...
building database for manual pages...
building profile with 2 packages...
hint: Consider setting the necessary environment variables by running:

     GUIX_PROFILE="/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship"
     . "$GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile"

Alternately, see `guix package --search-paths -p "/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship"'.
```

I've cloned the starship repo and checked out the most recent version:

```
$ pwd
/home/giuliano/temp/starship
$ git status
HEAD detached at v0.41.3
```

From here on I'll be running `cargo build --release` repeatedly, making note of each blocker. Round 1:

```
Error { kind: ToolNotFound, message: "Failed to find tool. Is `cc` installed?" }
```

This is easy, just `export CC=gcc`. If `gcc` is not available, then `guix install gcc-toolchain`.

```

```

`rustc --explain E0658` says that the code we're trying to build is using some experimental feature, which is only supported by "some" Rust compilers.

We can do two things here:

* Build in Docker and fix the resulting executable so that it uses the right Guix libraries.
* Use Guix to build a suitable Rust compiler.

Let's try Docker first. Before writing a Guix package, we'll want to know what's the earliest Rust compiler that works anyway. Docker is the quickest way to get that information.

```
$ docker pull rust:1.40.0
$ pwd
/home/giuliano/temp/starship
$ docker run -ti -v $PWD:/code rust:1.40.0 /bin/bash
root@fcfa2543de72:/# cd /code
root@fcfa2543de72:/code# cargo build --release
[..]
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.10s
root@fcfa2543de72:/code# find target -executable -name starship
target/release/starship
root@fcfa2543de72:/code# target/release/starship prompt

code on ÓÇ† HEAD (0dfe3f7) is üì¶ v0.41.3 via ü¶Ä v1.40.0
```

`rust@1.40.0` works! Should be easy to make a Guix package for that (at the time of writing, Guix ships with `rust@1.39.0`).

## Manually fixing the `rpath` (dynamic linker search path)

_Update_: I wrote this section before discovering [nonguix](https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix/). Its `binary-build-system` automates the patchelf gymnastics described below in a safe and reproducible way. I've used it for the first time to package `babashka` (some notes about that [here](babashka.md)).

Of course, trying to run `starship` outside of the Docker container yields an error:

```
./target/release/starship prompt
-bash: ./target/release/starship: No such file or directory
```

That's because the same "interpreter" (for a binary, interpreter == dynamic linker) that existed in the container, can't be found outside of it. Compare:

```
$ file ./target/release/starship
./target/release/starship: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=5cdc194bfcd64eeceac80dfe13d99620bb557fc3, with debug_info, not stripped
$ ls /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
ls: cannot access '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory
$ file $(readlink -f $(which bash))
/gnu/store/87kif0bpf0anwbsaw0jvg8fyciw4sz67-bash-5.0.16/bin/bash: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped
$ ls /gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
/gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

We can use `patchelf` (available in Guix) to change the binary and put the right interpreter in place:

```
$ sudo chown -R giuliano:users target
$ patchelf --set-interpreter /gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 target/release/starship
$ file ./target/release/starship
./target/release/starship: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=5cdc194bfcd64eeceac80dfe13d99620bb557fc3, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
$ ./target/release/starship
$ ./target/release/starship: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Ok, pretty sure we've got `libssl.so.1.1` in our profile, we just have to tell `starship` where to find it.

```
$ find -L ~/.guix-profile -name libssl.so.1.1
/home/giuliano/.guix-profile/lib/libssl.so.1.1
$ readlink -f /home/giuliano/.guix-profile/lib/libssl.so.1.1
/gnu/store/hcxpkksmbql6s4al8yy2myr25kh4cic0-openssl-1.1.1g/lib/libssl.so.1.1
```

We can do this by changing the [rpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath). The starship binary doesn't even set it:

```
$ patchelf --print-rpath target/release/starship
$
```

So let's give it the path to `libssl.so.1.1`:

```
$ patchelf --set-rpath /gnu/store/hcxpkksmbql6s4al8yy2myr25kh4cic0-openssl-1.1.1g/lib target/release/starship
$ target/release/starship
target/release/starship: error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Cool, it breaks on another libary, `libz.so.1`. We repeat the same procedure and add another library path to `rpath`, separating it with a colon.

```
$ readlink -f /home/giuliano/.guix-profile/lib/libz.so.1
/gnu/store/rykm237xkmq7rl1p0nwass01p090p88x-zlib-1.2.11/lib/libz.so.1.2.11
$ patchelf --set-rpath /gnu/store/hcxpkksmbql6s4al8yy2myr25kh4cic0-openssl-1.1.1g/lib:/gnu/store/rykm237xkmq7rl1p0nwass01p090p88x-zlib-1.2.11/lib target/release/starship
$ target/release/starship
target/release/starship: error while loading shared libraries: libgcc_s.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

`libgcc_s.so.1` isn't in an obvious place, maybe we can just take its path from `bash`:

```
$ find -L ~/.guix-profile -name libgcc_s.so.1
$
$ ldd $(readlink -f $(which bash)) | grep libgcc_s.so.1
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /gnu/store/01b4w3m6mp55y531kyi1g8shh722kwqm-gcc-7.5.0-lib/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007ff8ee2a6000)

We've got a working `starship`, built in a Docker container, running on Guix.

While this exercise was interesting, it's not a sustainable way to build things, even manually. Upgrading any of the packages we "borrowed" library paths from, would break `starship` too.

## A newer Rust

[packages/rust-newer.scm](../packages/rust-newer.scm) builds `rust@1.40.0`. That takes 2 hours on my system (WSL2, i5). The package might be poor quality (Guix n00b here) and for reasons I don't understand, I had to `(#:validate-runpath? #f)`. Anyway, let's install this new Rust in the throwaway profile we created at the beginning of this document:

```
$ guix package -p ~/temp/build-starship --install rust@1.40.0 rust@1.40.0:cargo
$ guix package -p ~/temp/build-starship -I
rust    1.40.0  out     /gnu/store/58rizji545xlfg1xzzga3qifh75yy2qj-rust-1.40.0
rust    1.40.0  cargo   /gnu/store/zfqxvz9vqbqz3by56iib5n2w90fyn7xf-rust-1.40.0-cargo
$
```

Try to build starship outside of Docker:

```
$ pwd
/home/giuliano/temp/starship
$ export CC=gcc
$ cargo build --release
```

It works!

Compare the rpath for the docker-built starship:

```
$ patchelf --print-rpath starship.docker | tr ':' '\n' | sort
/gnu/store/01b4w3m6mp55y531kyi1g8shh722kwqm-gcc-7.5.0-lib/lib
/gnu/store/01b4w3m6mp55y531kyi1g8shh722kwqm-gcc-7.5.0-lib/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/7.5.0/../../..
/gnu/store/fa6wj5bxkj5ll1d7292a70knmyl7a0cr-glibc-2.31/lib
/gnu/store/hcxpkksmbql6s4al8yy2myr25kh4cic0-openssl-1.1.1g/lib
/gnu/store/rykm237xkmq7rl1p0nwass01p090p88x-zlib-1.2.11/lib
starship/target/release on ÓÇ† HEAD (0dfe3f7) ‚ùØ
```

...with the one built directly in Guix, using the newer Rust:

```
$ patchelf --print-rpath starship | tr ':' '\n' | sort
/gnu/store/01b4w3m6mp55y531kyi1g8shh722kwqm-gcc-7.5.0-lib/lib/gcc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/7.5.0/../../..
/gnu/store/hcxpkksmbql6s4al8yy2myr25kh4cic0-openssl-1.1.1g/lib
/gnu/store/rykm237xkmq7rl1p0nwass01p090p88x-zlib-1.2.11/lib
/home/giuliano/.guix-profile/lib
```

## Cleanup

Now that we no longer need the `~/temp/build-starship` profile, let's remove it. Running `guix gc` gets rid of the newer Rust we've built (it removes it from the store).

```
$ rm ~/temp/build-starship
$ guix gc
$ ll /gnu/store/58rizji545xlfg1xzzga3qifh75yy2qj-rust-1.40.0
total 12
dr-xr-xr-x 4 root root 4096 Jun  2 22:07 share/
dr-xr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jun  2 22:07 lib/
dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun  2 22:07 bin/
$
```

Wait, Rust is still in the store?

That's because I've deleted the current `~/temp/build-starship` profile, but left the older generations around:

```
$ ls -1d ~/temp/build-starship*
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship-1-link
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship-2-link
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship-3-link
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship-4-link
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship-5-link
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship.lock
```

So try again by removing all the links (but leaving the `.lock` file untouched, I don't know what it is).

```
$ rm ~/temp/build-starship*link
$ ls -1d ~/temp/build-starship*
/home/giuliano/temp/build-starship.lock
$ guix gc
finding garbage collector roots...
[..]
$ ll /gnu/store/58rizji545xlfg1xzzga3qifh75yy2qj-rust-1.40.0
ls: cannot access '/gnu/store/58rizji545xlfg1xzzga3qifh75yy2qj-rust-1.40.0': No such file or directory
```

All gone.
